### Introduction

This is the backend IIRS Survey App Android App built using Python, Django & Spatialite-SQLite Database. Its primary function is to read an ArcGIS Shapefile and match the coordinates received from the frontend with the polygons in the shapefile. It then retrieves the relevant data associated with that location. The received data from the frontend is stored in the database using a PointField. <br/>

This was created during my Summer Internship Programme at Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS), Dehradun. Checkout the Android Application here:
